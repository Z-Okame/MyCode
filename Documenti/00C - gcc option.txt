GNU CC Command Options
**********************

   When you invoke GNU CC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the `-c' option says
not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output
by the assembler.

   Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

   The `gcc' program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multiletter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may *not* be grouped: `-dr' is very different from `-d -r'.

   You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the
order you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify `-L' more than
once, the directories are searched in the order specified.

Options Controlling the Kind of Output
======================================

   Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  The first three
stages apply to an individual source file, and end by producing an
object file; linking combines all the object files (those newly
compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file.

	Extensions
	=================
   For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind
of compilation is done:

`FILE.c'
     C source code which must be preprocessed.

`FILE.i'
     C source code which should not be preprocessed.

`FILE.m'
     Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the library
     `libobjc.a' to make an Objective-C program work.

`FILE.h'
     C header file (not to be compiled or linked).

`FILE.cc'
`FILE.cxx'
`FILE.cpp'
`FILE.C'
     C++ source code which must be preprocessed.  Note that in `.cxx',
     the last two letters must both be literally `x'.  Likewise, `.C'
     refers to a literal capital C.

`FILE.s'
     Assembler code.

	 Options
	 =====================
`-c'
     Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
     stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
     object file for each source file.

     By default, the object file name for a source file is made by
     replacing the suffix `.c', `.i', `.s', etc., with `.o'.

`-S'
     Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The
     output is in the form of an assembler code file for each
     non-assembler input file specified.

     By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
     replacing the suffix `.c', `.i', etc., with `.s'.

`-E'
     Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler
     proper.  The output is in the form of preprocessed source code,
     which is sent to the standard output.

`-o FILE'
     Place output in file FILE.  This applies regardless to whatever
     sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
     an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

     Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make
     sense to use `-o' when compiling more than one input file, unless
     you are producing an executable file as output.

     If `-o' is not specified, the default is to put an executable file
     in `a.out', the object file for `SOURCE.SUFFIX' in `SOURCE.o', its
     assembler file in `SOURCE.s', and all preprocessed C source on
     standard output.


Options That Control Optimization
=================================

   These options control various sorts of optimizations:

`-O'
`-O1'
     Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a
     lot more memory for a large function.

     Without `-O', the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of
     compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
     Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
     breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to
     any variable or change the program counter to any other statement
     in the function and get exactly the results you would expect from
     the source code.

     Without `-O', the compiler only allocates variables declared
     `register' in registers.  The resulting compiled code is a little
     worse than produced by PCC without `-O'.

     With `-O', the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
     time.

     When you specify `-O', the compiler turns on `-fthread-jumps' and
     `-fdefer-pop' on all machines.  The compiler turns on
     `-fdelayed-branch' on machines that have delay slots, and
     `-fomit-frame-pointer' on machines that can support debugging even
     without a frame pointer.  On some machines the compiler also turns
     on other flags.

`-O2'
     Optimize even more.  GNU CC performs nearly all supported
     optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The
     compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining when
     you specify `-O2'.  As compared to `-O', this option increases
     both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.

     `-O2' turns on all optional optimizations except for loop unrolling
     and function inlining.  It also turns on the `-fforce-mem' option
     on all machines and frame pointer elimination on machines where
     doing so does not interfere with debugging.

`-O3'
     Optimize yet more.  `-O3' turns on all optimizations specified by
     `-O2' and also turns on the `inline-functions' option.

`-O0'
     Do not optimize.

     If you use multiple `-O' options, with or without level numbers,
     the last such option is the one that is effective.

Many Other:
- Warning Options as
	`-Wall'
     All of the above `-W' options combined.  These are all the options
     which pertain to usage that we recommend avoiding and that we
     believe is easy to avoid, even in conjunction with macros.
	 
- Debugging Options as
	`-g'
     Produce debugging information in the operating system's native
     format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this
     debugging information.

     On most systems that use stabs format, `-g' enables use of extra
     debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
     makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other
     debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.
- Optimize Options as
	`-funroll-loops'
     Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is only done for
     loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time
     or run time.  `-funroll-loop' implies both `-fstrength-reduce' and
     `-frerun-cse-after-loop'.
- Preprocessor Options 
- Assembler Options
- Link Options
- Environment Variables
- etc.
